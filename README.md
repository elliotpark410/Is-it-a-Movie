# Is It a Movie

Movie adaptations are getting more popular in the 21st century when readers nowadays want a different way to enrich their imagination. "Is It a Movie?" comes into play when readers do not have the time or energy for reading. This application helps readers find out whether a movie adaptation has been created using Google Books APIs and IMDb API. If there is a movie adaptation, this application will retreive rating data from the APIs for comparison.

## Getting Started

When "Is It a Movie" runs on a browser, users are invited to enter a book title in a search box. This application utilizes Parsley JS's form validation library to automatically detect users' input.

After the search button is clicked, a simple confirmation page will be displayed for users to confirm whether the search title displayed is what they are looking for. After they confirm the title by clicking on the book title, the book cover will appear as designed, so does the movie poster if the movie is made based on the book. Users are able to see the book rating as well as the movie rating for comparison. 

A local storage feature is also in place so that users can see their search history when using this application.
